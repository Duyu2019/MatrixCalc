# MatrixCalc
a calculator for matrixes, what did you expect

What's up, I'm Dustin Yu. Currently a junior at Georgia Tech majoring in CS. This is my first self project,a calcultor for matrixes that will probably be able to add, subtract, and multiply 2 matrixes together by the time I'm done with the basic structure. Will probably add Gaussian elimination to row echeclon and rref form later.
